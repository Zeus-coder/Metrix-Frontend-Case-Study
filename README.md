● Pay attention to detail and try to match the design as closely as possible.
● Ensure your code is well-structured, modular, and follows best practices.
● Implement any necessary state management to handle user interactions and
data flow.
● You are free to use any additional libraries, frameworks, or tools you deem
necessary to complete the task.
● The assessment is timed for 2 days.
